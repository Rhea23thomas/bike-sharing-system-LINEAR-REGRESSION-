# Project Name - bike-sharing-system-LINEAR-REGRESSION

Building a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## Conclusions
Some findings from the problem statement

The heatmap clearly shows which all variable are multicollinear in nature, and which variable have high collinearity with the target variable.
We will refer this map back-and-forth while building the linear model so as to validate different correlated values along with VIF & p-value, for identifying the correct variable to select/eliminate from the model.

Removing the variable based on its High p-value & High VIF

This model looks good, as there seems to be VERY LOW Multicollinearity between the predictors and the p-values for all the predictors seems to be significant. 

From histogram on predicted values , we could see that the Residuals are normally distributed. Hence our assumption for Linear Regression is valid.
